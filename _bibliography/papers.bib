  abstract="In Transformer-based Speech-to-Text (S2T) translation, an encoder-decoder model is trained end-to-end to take as input an untranscribed acoustic signal in the source language and directly generate a text translation in the target language. S2T translation models can also be trained in multilingual setups where a single front-end speech encoder is shared across multiple languages. A lingering question, however, is whether the encoder represents spoken utterances in a language-neutral space. In this paper, we present an interpretability study of encoder representations in a multilingual speech translation Transformer via various probing tasks. Our main findings show that while encoder representations are not entirely language-neutral, there exists a semantic subspace that is shared across different languages. Furthermore, we discuss our findings and the implication of our study on cross-lingual learning for spoken language understanding tasks.",

  abstract="While existing literature relies on performance differences to uncover gender biases in ASR models, a deeper analysis is essential to understand how gender is encoded and utilized during transcript generation. This work investigates the encoding and utilization of gender in the latent representations of two transformer-based ASR models, Wav2Vec2 and HuBERT. Using linear erasure, we demonstrate the feasibility of removing gender information from each layer of an ASR model and show that such an intervention has minimal impacts on the ASR performance. Additionally, our analysis reveals a concentration of gender information within the first and last frames in the final layers, explaining the ease of erasing gender in these layers. Our findings suggest the prospect of creating gender-neutral embeddings that can be integrated into ASR frameworks without compromising their efficacy.",

  abstract="Transformer-based, pre-trained speech models have shown striking performance when finetuned on various downstream tasks such as automatic speech recognition and spoken language identification (SLID). However, the problem of domain mismatch remains a challenge in this area, where the domain of the pre-training data might differ from that of the downstream labeled data used for finetuning. In multilingual tasks such as SLID, the pre-trained speech model may not support all the languages in the downstream task. To address this challenge, we propose self-supervised adaptive pre-training (SAPT) to adapt the pre-trained model to the target domain and languages of the downstream data. We apply SAPT to the XLSR-128 model and investigate the effectiveness of this approach for the SLID task. First, we demonstrate that SAPT improves XLSR’s performance on the FLEURS benchmark with substantial gains up to 40.1\% for under-represented languages. Second, we apply SAPT on four different datasets in a few-shot learning setting, showing that our approach improves the sample efficiency of XLSR during finetuning. Our experiments provide strong empirical evidence that continual adaptation via self-supervision improves downstream performance for multilingual speech models.",

However, it remains unclear how to characterize the relationship between these discrete units and abstract phonetic categories such as phonemes. In this paper, we develop an information-theoretic framework whereby we represent each phonetic category as a distribution over discrete units. We then apply our framework to two different self-supervised models (namely, wav2vec 2.0 and XLSR) and use American English speech as a case study. Our study demonstrates that the entropy of phonetic distributions reflects the variability of the underlying speech sounds, with phonetically similar sounds exhibiting similar distributions. While our study confirms the lack of direct one-to-one correspondence, we find an intriguing indirect relationship between phonetic categories and discrete units.",

Concretely, we define an information-theoretic measure of harmonicity based on the predictability of vowels in a natural language lexicon, which we estimate using phoneme-level language models (PLMs). Prior quantitative studies have heavily relied on inflected word-forms in the analysis on vowel harmony. On the contrary, we train our models using cross-linguistically comparable lemma forms with little or no inflection, which enables us to cover more under-studied languages. Training data for our PLMs consists of word lists offering a maximum of 1000 entries per language. Despite the fact that the data we employ are substantially smaller than previously used corpora, our experiments demonstrate the neural PLMs capture vowel harmony patterns in a set of languages that exhibit this phenomenon. Our work also demonstrates that word lists are a valuable resource for typological research, and offers new possibilities for future studies on low-resource, under-studied languages.",

Self-supervised speech models, such as wav2vec 2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020) and HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021), have shown significant promise in improving the performance across different speech processing tasks. One of the main advantages of self-supervised speech models is that they can be pre-trained on a large sample of languages (Conneau et al., 2020; Babu et al.,2022), which facilitates cross-lingual transfer for low-resource languages (San et al., 2021). State-of-the-art self-supervised speech models include a quantization module that transforms the continuous acoustic input into a sequence of discrete units. One of the key questions in this area is whether the discrete representations learned via self-supervision are language-specific or language-universal. In other words, we ask: do the discrete units learned by a multilingual speech model represent the same speech sounds across languages or do they differ based on the specific language being spoken? From the practical perspective, this question has important implications for the development of speech models that can generalize across languages, particularly for low-resource languages. Furthermore, examining the level of linguistic abstraction in speech models that lack symbolic supervision is also relevant to the field of human language acquisition (Dupoux, 2018).",

Our model is based on a recurrent neural network that learns to map a word{'}s phonological sequence onto a semantic representation of the word.

  abstract="Models of acoustic word embeddings (AWEs) learn to map variable-length spoken word segments onto fixed-dimensionality vector representations such that different acoustic exemplars of the same word are projected nearby in the embedding space. In addition to their speech technology applications, AWE models have been shown to predict human performance on a variety of auditory lexical processing tasks. Current AWE models are based on neural networks and trained in a bottom-up approach that integrates acoustic cues to build up a word representation given an acoustic or symbolic supervision signal. Therefore, these models do not leverage or capture high-level lexical knowledge during the learning process. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning model that incorporates top-down lexical knowledge into the training procedure of AWEs. Our model learns a mapping between the acoustic input and a lexical representation that encodes high-level information such as word semantics in addition to bottom-up form-based supervision. We experiment with three languages and demonstrate that incorporating lexical knowledge improves the embedding space discriminability and encourages the model to better separate lexical categories.",

However, it remains unclear to what degree we can rely on the distance in the emerging AWE space as an estimate of word-form similarity. In this paper, we ask: does the distance in the acoustic embedding space correlate with phonological dissimilarity? To answer this question, we empirically investigate the performance of supervised approaches for AWEs with different neural architectures and learning objectives. We train AWE models in controlled settings for two languages (German and Czech) and evaluate the embeddings on two tasks: word discrimination and phonological similarity. Our experiments show that (1) the distance in the embedding space in the best cases only moderately correlates with phonological distance, and (2) improving the performance on the word discrimination task does not necessarily yield models that better reflect word phonological similarity. Our findings highlight the necessity to rethink the current intrinsic evaluations for AWEs. ",

This year{'}s shared task on robust spoken language identification sought to investigate just this scenario: systems were to be trained on largely single-speaker speech from one domain, but evaluated on data in other domains recorded from speakers under different recording circumstances, mimicking realistic low-resource scenarios. We see that domain and speaker mismatch proves very challenging for current methods which can perform above 95{\%} accuracy in-domain, which domain adaptation can address to some degree, but that these conditions merit further investigation to make spoken language identification accessible in many scenarios.",

In this paper, we present a neural model for Slavic language identification in speech signals and analyze its emergent representations to investigate whether they reflect objective measures of language relatedness or non-linguists{'} perception of language similarity. While our analysis shows that the language representation space indeed captures language relatedness to a great extent, we find perceptual confusability to be the best predictor of the language representation similarity.",

    abstract = "Transformer-based language models achieve high performance on various tasks, but we still lack understanding of the kind of linguistic knowledge they learn and rely on. We evaluate three models (BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT), testing their grammatical and semantic knowledge by sentence-level probing, diagnostic cases, and masked prediction tasks. We focus on relative clauses (in American English) as a complex phenomenon needing contextual information and antecedent identification to be resolved. Based on a naturalistic dataset, probing shows that all three models indeed capture linguistic knowledge about grammaticality, achieving high performance. Evaluation on diagnostic cases and masked prediction tasks considering fine-grained linguistic knowledge, however, shows pronounced model-specific weaknesses especially on semantic knowledge, strongly impacting models{'} performance. Our results highlight the importance of (a)model comparison in evaluation task and (b) building up claims of model performance and the linguistic knowledge they capture beyond purely probing-based evaluations.",

  abstract = "State-of-the-art spoken language identification (LID) systems, which are based on end-to-end deep neural networks, have shown remarkable success not only in discriminating between distant languages but also between closely-related languages or even different spoken varieties of the same language. However, it is still unclear to what extent neural LID models generalize to speech samples with different acoustic conditions due to domain shift. In this paper, we present a set of experiments to investigate the impact of domain mismatch on the performance of neural LID systems for a subset of six Slavic languages across two domains (read speech and radio broadcast) and examine two low-level signal descriptors (spectral and cepstral features) for this task. Our experiments show that (1) out-of-domain speech samples severely hinder the performance of neural LID models, and (2) while both spectral and cepstral features show comparable performance within-domain, spectral features show more robustness under domain mismatch. Moreover, we apply unsupervised domain adaptation to minimize the discrepancy between the two domains in our study. We achieve relative accuracy improvements that range from 9% to 77% depending on the diversity of acoustic conditions in the source domain. ",

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
