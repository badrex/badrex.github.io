Hey there 👋🏼 I'm Badr, a **Computational Speech Processing** researcher and **Language Technology** expert.

My work focuses on applying machine learning to various problems in **Speech Technology** [audio modality 💬] and **Natural Language Processing** [text modality 📝]. I have always been excited about broadening language technology to many of the under-represented languages of the world.


I have a PhD in **Computational Linguistics** from Saarland University. My PhD dissertation introduced novel methods for understanding the representation of speech variability in deep neural networks, providing an interdisciplinary perspective that connects sociolinguistics and machine learning. Before that, I completed my Master in the [**LCT**](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/lct-coli/) program with the prestigious **Erasmus Mundus scholarship** funded by the European Commission.


I am a currently working as a researcher in the [Language Science and Technology Department](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html). I work with [Dietrich Klakow](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=_HtGYmoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao) and [Bernd Möbius](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~moebius/mywww/index.html).


I am always excited to chat and learn more about ...

* **AI Applications for Social Good** 🍏 Whether we like it or not, AI will impact many aspects of our lives. So how do we steer AI technologies to make a positive social impact? From education to healthcare, what are the possibilities and challenges?

* **Language Technology and Digital Humanities** 📚 Our ancestors have left us a wealth of knowledge. Can intelligent language technologies help preserve this rich cultural heritage? How can we make humankind's historical wisdom accessible and searchable for all curious minds?

<!-- * **Language Processing in Humans and Machines** 🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at processing and generating natural language. Can they teach us something about language processing in the human brain? Can our linguistic theories inspire us to build computational frameworks for neural network interpretability? -->

* **Multilinguality and Language Variation** 🌐 Not all languages are fairly represented in today’s language technology. How can we develop language technologies that are more inclusive and celebrate the linguistic diversity of humankind?
